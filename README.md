I am a PhD student working with Prof. Samar Husain at the [Psycholinguistics Lab](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~samar/lab.html) housed in the [Linguistics Unit](https://sites.google.com/view/iit-delhi-linguistics) at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT-Delhi.

As a psycholinguist, my broad interests lie in the area of sentence processing in SOV languages. I am currently working on exploring the role of event complexity in prediction using experimental methods.
