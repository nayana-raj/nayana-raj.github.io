I'm Nayana (pronounced /naj…ôna/).

I am a PhD candidate working with Prof. Samar Husain at the [Psycholinguistics Lab](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~samar/lab.html) housed in the [Linguistics Unit](https://sites.google.com/view/iit-delhi-linguistics) at the [Department of Humanities and Social Sciences](https://hss.iitd.ac.in/), IIT-Delhi.

As a psycholinguist, my broad interests lie in the area of sentence processing in SOV languages. I am currently working on exploring the interaction of predictive processing and morphological complexity in agglutinating languages such as [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_grammar) using experimental methods.
