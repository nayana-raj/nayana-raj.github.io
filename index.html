                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I'm Nayana (pronounced /najəna/), and I really like minimal personal websites.</p>
                <p>I am a doctoral candidate working with Prof. Samar Husain at the <a href="https://web.iitd.ac.in/~samar/lab.html" target="_blank">Psycholinguistics Lab</a>, housed in the Linguistics Unit at the <a href="https://hss.iitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT-Delhi</a>.</p>
                <p>As a psycholinguist, my broad interests lie in the area of sentence processing in SOV languages. I am currently working on exploring the interaction of predictive processing and morphological complexity in agglutinating languages such as Malayalam using behavioural and eye-tracking experiments, alongside corpus-based methods. I have also worked with morphologically complex languages such as Bangla and Mundari, and sparser ones like Hindi and Urdu.</p>
                <p> If you would like to chat about my work, please mail me at <b><a href="mailto:nayana.raj@hss.iitd.ac.in" class="email-link">nayana [dot] raj [at] hss [dot] iitd [dot] ac [dot] in</a></b>. I also do enjoy fretting about the many aspectual forms in Malayalam, so if you work on anything aspect-adjacent in your language, I'd love to compare notes as well.</p>
